The roadmap is the following. Items at the beginning of the list are somewhat higher priority.

* Add support for eager_loading on raw queries.
* Write a bunch of recipes and patterns.
* Support type definitions like `[Integer]` to specify typed arrays.
* Provide a lazy migration mechanism.
* Provide a connection pool.
* Provide 2PC primitives since we don't have transactions.
* Support embedded documents. Embedding should be done by using the type system like regular fields.
* Make NoBrainer really fast.
